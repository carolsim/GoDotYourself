- **The Goal**
The final goal of the project “**GO DOT YOURSELF**” is automatically converting high resolution images into an output that approximates the manual results of pixel artists. So that this could assist many people who design their own image.

## User Description

The website would be pretty simple and would not have many features.

- Upload an image

- Select masking size and whether to remove background.

- Click ‘convert’ button

- Show the result of conversion: pixelated image of uploaded picture

- Upload another image or leave
